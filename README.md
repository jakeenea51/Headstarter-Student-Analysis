This hackathon was focused on using a provided dataset to create a dashboard designed to help Headstarter decide which students should be sent discount codes and merchandise in the most effective way possible to provide the largest return for both the students and Headstarter.

Using the streamlit, plotly, and pandas libraries, our team created a fully interactive dashboard with several useful features for finding the perfect students to hand these benefits out to. These features include:
- Student search bar
- Sort students by metrics
- Display box plots for student metrics
- Analysis of high correlations between metrics
- Fine-tune select students based on rankings in important metrics
