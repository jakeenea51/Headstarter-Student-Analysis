People who have complaints should probably not receive the promo

We can possibly correlate average teammate rating with other data such as money spent

People who are in the top 10% of highest days since last cohort maybe should not receive the promo

People earning the highest incomes and shortest days since last cohort, especially those who have high minutes and overall engagement
with Headstarter should definitely receive the promo

People with high site visits, high minutes coding, low degrees, and but low money spent should be targeted

In-college and bachelor's are probably our primary demographic generally

We can look at whether or not highest leaderboard rank people 

We want people who: Are in college or have a bachelor's, are young, have a low amount of days since last cohort,
have a high number of time on headstarter, more referrals, high emails open (especially no one who has 0), a modest
number of courses purchased*, high headstarter rating, and no complaints. A high income or probabiltiy of offer may be indicative
of the person not needing Headstarter and therefore should not receive the discount. 

*A high amount spent on courses/Headstarter indicates that the person may not care about spending a lot of money
and so giving them a discount would be a waste/loss.


People who have a high number of time spent on headstarter and a low headstarter rating shoud definitely not get the discount

            -started by calculating averages 
            - made graphs and comapred the averages to help understand any correlation
